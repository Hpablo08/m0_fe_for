# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `for` statement?
> I feel so so. i definitely need more practical practice.

- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?
>Today was rough. Well harder than any other day so far. I definitely was on the struggle bus. I had both productive and un productive struggles. Thankfully reaching out to other classmates not in me little group helped for sure as well as taking a break from the computer itself.

- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
> I want to review else if statement and for statements. I will set aside time on my calender for practical practicing.

- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
> I'm still unclear on the whole construct of a for statement and how to enter other elements into it such as if statements and booleans. I will converse with my classmates and search on google for more answers.
